# Customer Churn

This project is titled "Performance Evaluation of Various Classification Techniques for Customer Churn Prediction in E-commerce." The main goal of this project was to predict when customers might stop shopping at an online store (customer churn) using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project, `E Commerce Dataset.xlsx`, was collected from Kaggle repositories. It belongs to a leading online E-Commerce company aiming to identify customers who might churn, allowing the company to proactively offer promotions.

The dataset is organized into two folders:
- **Data dict**: Contains variable names and their meanings as per the company.
- **E-comm**: Contains 19 columns of user-related information, including CustomerID, Churn, PreferredLoginDevice, PreferredPaymentMode, HourSpendOnApp, NumberOfDeviceRegistered, and more.

## Detailed Project Explanation - Customer Churn Prediction for E-commerce

### Project Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for customer churn, a critical concern for e-commerce businesses.
- Explore the effectiveness of various classification techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Utilize a real-world e-commerce dataset with features like purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information.

### Motivation
- Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge from coursework and practical application in the real world.
- Explore the dynamic e-commerce sector and the significant impact of accurate customer churn prediction on business strategies.

### Project Execution
1. **Data Exploration**: Conducted data cleaning and gained an understanding of available features.
2. **Model Selection and Implementation**:
   - Implemented multiple classification techniques:
     - *Logistic Regression*: A straightforward method for binary classification.
     - *Naive Bayes*: Based on probabilistic principles.
     - *Decision Trees*: Offers interpretability and insights.
     - *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*: Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
   - Assessed each technique's suitability for the problem.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Used evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.
   - Identified the best-performing model for customer churn prediction.

### Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with machine learning models and real-world datasets.
- Developed an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different classification techniques.
- Recognized the potential impact of customer churn prediction on business strategies.

In summary, this project served as a bridge between academic studies and real-world applications of machine learning, allowing exploration of different techniques and insights in the e-commerce sector.
